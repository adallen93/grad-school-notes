**Rule 4: Worry about Data Quality**

* Garbage in, garbage out
* Be careful about data pre-processing
    - Data cleaning 
        - What are you doing with missing values?
        - How are you handling errors? 
    - Data transformation 
        - What variables are you transforming? 
        - How are you changing the data? 
* Data cleaning/munging/wrangling
* Understand units of measurements
    - Do you know how missing values are coded?
    - Example: 999 may mean it's a missing value or it could mean '999'
    - Try to understand as much as you can about the data and the data generating process
* After data are cleaned, perform exploratory analysis
    - Look for outliers
    - Look for anything that goes against biology/nature
    - Look for patterns. Explore! But remember to never use the same dataset to generate a hypothesis and test it
