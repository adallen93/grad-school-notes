#### Lecture Portion

**Stating and Refining the Question**

* We talked about understanding the background
    - What the investigator tells you

* Descriptive Questions
* Exploratory questions
    - Identify patterns, trends or other relationships between variables
    * questins are "hypothesis generating"
        - Does what we learn in the explratory anlaysis hold up in additional studies?
    - Does the pattern we see suggest a hypothesis?
    - Examples
        - GWAS
        - Is the prevalence of active TV asssociated with glycemia control?
* Inferential Questions
    - Most of what you have learned so far is aimed at answering inferential questions
    - What does the data say about our hypothesis in a new population?
    - How does our dataset (the sample) match the assumed population?
    - Does our data fit the assumed distribution?
    - Examples
        - Distribution of BDNF genotypes in people with depression
* Causal Questions
    - Desire to infer cause and effect
        - Requires special study designs (RCT)


* Predictive Questionss
    - Guess what will happen in the future
    - may have a statistical model in place
    - Need to consider the sample and target population
    - Examples
        - What are the predictors of depression?
* Mechanistic Question
    - How does this happen?
    - What are the underlying biological pathways?

**Turning questions into hypotheses**

* Some types of questions are not specified as statistical hypotheses
    - Descriptive
    - Exploratory
* Requires specificity
    - How exactly will we measure joint pain?
* Requires specification of the population
    - Who are we talking about?
* Where will we get the data? an we get the data?
* Hypotheses + data $\rightarrow$ SAP. 

**Describing Data**

* In many cases, investigators have some dta they are interested in analyzing
* in other cases, we need to collect data
* What are the units of observation?
    - Subjects
    - Mice
    - Schools
* What are the inclusion/exclusion criteria?
    - How do subjects get in to the study?
    - Which subjects are not eligible?
    - How do the eligibility criteria change the target population?
* How was teh data collected?
* How was data quality assured? 
    - Each time someone touches the data there is an opportunity for error
    - Need to think about which errors are the most damaigng

**How do we get data?**

* Text
    - requires computer entry
* Text files
* Spreadsheets
* Analysis ready files
    - SAS datasets
    * R dataframes
* **For all sources of data, we need:**
    - Data dictionary
